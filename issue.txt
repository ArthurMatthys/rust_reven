The issue here is that we have a given fallback function in our struct `Mystruct` that is taking 
a reference as a parameter.
The parameter that we are trying to feed is an other reference.
In order for this to compile, the compiler needs to know that the reference we're 
trying to feed outlive the callback lifetime.

The solution I submit assumes that we will always give the same type to the callbacks,
since they are stored in the `MyStruct` struct and not a parameter of the `do_something` function.
